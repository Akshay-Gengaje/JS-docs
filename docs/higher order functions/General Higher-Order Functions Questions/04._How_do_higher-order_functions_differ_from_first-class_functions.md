# How do higher-order functions differ from first-class functions?

In JavaScript, **higher-order functions (HOFs)** and **first-class functions** are related but distinct concepts.  

---

## **1. First-Class Functions: What Are They?**  
A **first-class function** is a function that is **treated like any other value** in JavaScript. This means:  
âœ… Functions can be **assigned to variables**.  
âœ… Functions can be **passed as arguments** to other functions.  
âœ… Functions can be **returned from other functions**.  
âœ… Functions can be **stored in arrays and objects**.  

### **Example: Assigning a Function to a Variable (First-Class Function)**
```javascript
const sayHello = function() {
    return "Hello, world!";
};

console.log(sayHello());  // âœ… "Hello, world!"
```
âœ” Here, `sayHello` is assigned to a variable, demonstrating that functions are **first-class citizens**.  

### **Example: Passing a Function as an Argument**
```javascript
function execute(fn) {
    return fn();
}

function greet() {
    return "Hi there!";
}

console.log(execute(greet));  // âœ… "Hi there!"
```
âœ” **Since functions can be passed as arguments, JavaScript supports first-class functions.**

## **2. Higher-Order Functions: What Are They?**  
A **higher-order function (HOF)** is a function that **takes another function as an argument or returns a function**.  

### **Example: Higher-Order Function That Takes a Function as an Argument**
```javascript
function repeatAction(action, times) {
    for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        action();
    }
}

repeatAction(() => console.log("Hello!"), 3);
// âœ… "Hello!"
// âœ… "Hello!"
// âœ… "Hello!"
```
âœ” `repeatAction` is a **higher-order function** because it **accepts a function (`action`) as an argument**.  

### **Example: Higher-Order Function That Returns a Function**
```javascript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
    return function (num) {
        return num * factor;
    };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
console.log(double(5));  // âœ… 10
```
âœ” `createMultiplier` **returns a function**, making it a **higher-order function**.

## **3. Key Differences Between First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**  

| Feature                 | **First-Class Functions**                                     | **Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)**                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Functions are treated like any other variable. | A function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function. |
| **Main Purpose**         | Enables functions to be assigned, stored, and passed around. | Enables abstraction, reusability, and functional programming. |
| **Function Behavior**    | Can be stored in variables, arrays, or objects. | Can accept or return functions for flexible logic. |
| **Example**             | Assigning a function to a variable. | Using `.map()`, `.filter()`, function factories, etc. |

## **4. Interview-Ready Answer**  
ðŸ’¡ **"First-class functions mean that functions are treated as valuesâ€”they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions. A higher-order function (HOF) is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function. All functions in JavaScript are first-class, but only some functions are higher-order functions."**
