# What is the time complexity of map()?

The **time complexity of `map()` is O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.  

#### **Why is `map()` O(n)?**
- `map()` **iterates through each element of the array exactly once**.  
- It applies the callback function to each element, meaning the execution time **scales linearly** with the number of elements.

### **✅ Example: Understanding the Complexity**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubled);  // ✅ [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
✔ Here, the callback function (`num * 2`) runs **once per element**, leading to **O(n) complexity**.

### **📌 How Does Callback Complexity Affect `map()`?**
The overall time complexity of `map()` depends on the **complexity of the callback function**:

1. **O(1) Callback (Constant Time)**
   ```javascript
   arr.map(x => x * 2);  // O(n) overall
   ```
   - Each element is processed in **constant time**.
   - Overall complexity: **O(n)**.

2. **O(log n) Callback**
   ```javascript
   arr.map(x => Math.log2(x));  // O(n log n) overall
   ```
   - If the callback function runs in **O(log n)** time, the overall complexity becomes **O(n log n)**.

3. **O(n) Callback (Nested Loop)**
   ```javascript
   arr.map(x => arr.reduce((sum, y) => sum + y, 0));  // O(n²) overall
   ```
   - If the callback function itself runs in **O(n)**, the overall complexity becomes **O(n²)**.

### **✅ Comparison with `forEach()` and `for` Loop**
| Method  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Mutates Original Array? |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **`map()`**  | O(n) | O(n) (creates a new array) | ❌ No |
| **`forEach()`** | O(n) | O(1) | ✅ Yes (if modifying elements) |
| **`for` loop** | O(n) | O(1) | ✅ Yes (if modifying elements) |

✔ **Key Difference:**  
- `map()` returns a **new array**, while `forEach()` and `for` loops modify data **in place**.

### **📌 Interview-Ready Answer**
💡 **"`map()` has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over each element of the array exactly once. However, the overall complexity can be higher if the callback function has additional operations, such as nested loops (O(n²)) or logarithmic computations (O(n log n))."`**
