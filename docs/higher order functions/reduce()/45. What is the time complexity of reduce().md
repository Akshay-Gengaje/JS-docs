# What is the time complexity of reduce()?

The `reduce()` method iterates over an array and applies a callback function to **accumulate** a single result. The **time complexity** of `reduce()` depends on the number of elements in the array and the operations performed inside the callback.

---

## **🔹 Basic Time Complexity**
The `reduce()` function processes each element **once**, making its time complexity:  
### **`O(n)` → Linear Time Complexity**
- **n** is the length of the array.
- Each element is visited **exactly once**.
- The number of operations grows linearly with **n**.

### **Example (Summing an Array)**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // ✅ Output: 15
```
✔ **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** → One operation per element.

## **🔹 When `reduce()` Can Be Slower**
The time complexity **increases** if the callback function inside `reduce()` performs additional computations.

### **1️⃣ Nested Operations Inside `reduce()`**
If the callback performs **another iteration** inside itself (like using `.map()`, `.filter()`, or another `.reduce()`), the complexity increases.

#### **Example (Reduce with `filter()`) → `O(n²)`**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const duplicatesRemoved = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (!acc.includes(num)) { // `includes()` is O(n)
    acc.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, []);

console.log(duplicatesRemoved); // ✅ Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
- **`includes()` is `O(n)`** because it checks if `num` exists in `acc` for each iteration.
- Since `reduce()` itself is `O(n)`, this results in **`O(n²)`** complexity.

## **🔹 Special Cases**
### **2️⃣ Using `reduce()` with Objects (Hash Maps)**
- If `reduce()` uses a **hash map (`{}` or `Map` object)**, it can store and retrieve values in **O(1)** time.
- This keeps the overall complexity **O(n)**.

#### **Example (Counting Occurrences Using an Object)**
```javascript
const words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"];

const wordCount = words.reduce((acc, word) => {
  acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1; // O(1) lookup & assignment
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(wordCount); // ✅ Output: { apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }
```
✔ **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (Efficient because object property lookup is `O(1)`)

---

## **🔹 Worst-Case Scenarios**
The worst-case complexity can go beyond `O(n)` if:
- The callback function itself has **nested loops** (`O(n²)`, `O(n³)`, etc.).
- If using `reduce()` with **recursion**, it may even lead to **exponential complexity (`O(2ⁿ)`)** in certain scenarios.

## **📌 Interview-Ready Answer**
💡 **"The time complexity of `reduce()` is `O(n)`, as it iterates through the array once. However, if the callback function performs additional operations, such as searching (`O(n)`) or nested iterations (`O(n²)`), the complexity can increase. Using hash maps (`{}` or `Map`) inside `reduce()` keeps it efficient at `O(n)`."**
