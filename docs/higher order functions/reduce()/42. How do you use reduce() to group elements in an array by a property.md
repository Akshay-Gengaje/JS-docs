# How do you use reduce() to group elements in an array by a property?

The `reduce()` function is a powerful tool for **grouping elements** in an array based on a specific property. It allows us to organize data into an object where each key represents a unique property value, and the corresponding value is an array of elements that share that property.

## **âœ… Example 1: Grouping Objects by a Property (`category`)**  
Let's say we have an array of products and want to group them by their category.

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Apple", category: "Fruit" },
  { name: "Banana", category: "Fruit" },
  { name: "Carrot", category: "Vegetable" },
  { name: "Broccoli", category: "Vegetable" },
  { name: "Orange", category: "Fruit" }
];

const groupedProducts = products.reduce((acc, product) => {
  const key = product.category; // Grouping by 'category'

  if (!acc[key]) {
    acc[key] = []; // Initialize an empty array if key doesn't exist
  }

  acc[key].push(product); // Push the product into the appropriate group
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(groupedProducts);
```
âœ… **Output:**
```javascript
{
  Fruit: [
    { name: 'Apple', category: 'Fruit' },
    { name: 'Banana', category: 'Fruit' },
    { name: 'Orange', category: 'Fruit' }
  ],
  Vegetable: [
    { name: 'Carrot', category: 'Vegetable' },
    { name: 'Broccoli', category: 'Vegetable' }
  ]
}
```

âœ” **How It Works?**  
1. We start with an **empty object `{}`** as the accumulator (`acc`).  
2. We check if the **category already exists** as a key in `acc`:  
   - If **not**, initialize an empty array (`acc[key] = []`).  
   - If **yes**, push the current object into the respective category.  
3. The final result is an object where **each key is a category**, and the value is an **array of products in that category**.

## **âœ… Example 2: Grouping People by Age**  
Let's group an array of people based on their age.

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 25 },
  { name: "David", age: 30 },
  { name: "Eve", age: 35 }
];

const groupedByAge = people.reduce((acc, person) => {
  const key = person.age; // Grouping by 'age'

  if (!acc[key]) {
    acc[key] = [];
  }

  acc[key].push(person);
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(groupedByAge);
```
âœ… **Output:**
```javascript
{
  '25': [ { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }, { name: 'Charlie', age: 25 } ],
  '30': [ { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }, { name: 'David', age: 30 } ],
  '35': [ { name: 'Eve', age: 35 } ]
}
```

âœ” **How It Works?**  
- **Each age** becomes a key in the object.  
- The values are **arrays of people with the same age**.

## **âœ… Example 3: Grouping Words by Their First Letter**  
We can also group words based on their **first letter**.

```javascript
const words = ["apple", "banana", "apricot", "blueberry", "cherry"];

const groupedByFirstLetter = words.reduce((acc, word) => {
  const key = word[0]; // First letter as key

  if (!acc[key]) {
    acc[key] = [];
  }

  acc[key].push(word);
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(groupedByFirstLetter);
```
âœ… **Output:**
```javascript
{
  a: [ 'apple', 'apricot' ],
  b: [ 'banana', 'blueberry' ],
  c: [ 'cherry' ]
}
```
âœ” **How It Works?**  
- Each **first letter** becomes a **key** in the object.  
- Words that **start with the same letter** are grouped in an array.

## **ðŸ“Œ Interview-Ready Answer**  
ðŸ’¡ **"We can use `reduce()` to group elements in an array by a specific property. The key for each group is extracted from the object, and an array is created or updated inside the accumulator. This method is useful for categorizing data, such as grouping products by category, people by age, or words by their first letter."**
