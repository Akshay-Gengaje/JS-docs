# How can reduce() be used to count occurrences of elements in an array?

The `reduce()` function is **perfect** for counting occurrences because it can **accumulate counts** in an object while iterating through the array.

## **âœ… Example 1: Counting Occurrences of Numbers**  
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1];

const count = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  acc[curr] = (acc[curr] || 0) + 1;
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(count); 
// âœ… Output: { '1': 4, '2': 3, '3': 3 }
```
âœ” **How It Works?**  
1. We start with an **empty object** `{}` as the accumulator (`acc`).  
2. For each element (`curr`), we check if `acc[curr]` exists:
   - If **yes**, increment it.  
   - If **no**, initialize it as `1`.  
3. The final object contains **element frequencies**.

## **âœ… Example 2: Counting Words in a Sentence**  
```javascript
const sentence = "hello world hello everyone";
const words = sentence.split(" "); // Convert to array

const wordCount = words.reduce((acc, word) => {
  acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1;
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(wordCount);
// âœ… Output: { hello: 2, world: 1, everyone: 1 }
```
âœ” **How It Works?**  
- We **split** the string into an **array of words**.  
- Then we use `reduce()` to count occurrences in the same way as with numbers.

## **âœ… Example 3: Counting Object Property Occurrences**  
If you have an **array of objects**, you can count occurrences of a specific property.

```javascript
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Alice", age: 40 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
];

const nameCount = people.reduce((acc, person) => {
  acc[person.name] = (acc[person.name] || 0) + 1;
  return acc;
}, {});

console.log(nameCount);
// âœ… Output: { Alice: 2, Bob: 2 }
```
âœ” **How It Works?**  
- We extract `name` from each object and **count** how many times each name appears.

ðŸ’¡ **"We can use `reduce()` to count occurrences in an array by initializing an empty object `{}` and incrementing the count for each element. If the key exists, we increment it; otherwise, we initialize it to `1`. This works for numbers, words, and even object properties."**
