# How do closures work in map(), filter(), and reduce() functions?

Closures play a key role in JavaScript’s **higher-order functions** like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. These functions take **callbacks** as arguments, and closures allow these callbacks to **retain access** to variables from their outer scope.

## **1. Closures in `map()`**
The `map()` function creates a **new array** by applying a callback function to each element of an array.

### ✅ **Example: Using a Closure with `map()`**
```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function (num) {
        return num * factor; // Closure retains `factor`
    };
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubleNumbers = numbers.map(multiplyBy(2)); // Closure remembers `factor = 2`
console.log(doubleNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
✔️ **`multiplyBy(2)` returns a closure** that retains access to `factor`.  
✔️ The closure applies `factor * num` inside `map()`, transforming the array.

## **2. Closures in `filter()`**
The `filter()` function creates a **new array** containing elements that pass a test.

### ✅ **Example: Using a Closure with `filter()`**
```javascript
function greaterThan(minValue) {
    return function (num) {
        return num > minValue; // Closure retains `minValue`
    };
}

const numbers = [3, 7, 1, 9, 4, 6];
const filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(greaterThan(5)); // Closure remembers `minValue = 5`
console.log(filteredNumbers); // [7, 9, 6]
```
✔️ **`greaterThan(5)` returns a closure** that retains `minValue = 5`.  
✔️ The closure filters numbers greater than `5`.

---

## **3. Closures in `reduce()`**
The `reduce()` function **accumulates** values from an array into a single value.

### ✅ **Example: Using a Closure with `reduce()`**
```javascript
function createSumLogger(prefix) {
    return function (acc, num) {
        console.log(`${prefix} Adding ${num}`);
        return acc + num; // Closure retains `prefix`
    };
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const total = numbers.reduce(createSumLogger("Sum:"), 0); // Closure remembers `prefix = "Sum:"`
console.log("Total:", total);
```
✔️ The closure **retains `prefix`** and logs messages while summing.  
✔️ The `reduce()` function **accumulates** values using the closure.

## **4. Interview-Ready Answer**
💡 **"Closures work in `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` by allowing callback functions to retain access to variables from their outer scope. This enables dynamic transformations in `map()`, conditional filtering in `filter()`, and customized accumulation in `reduce()`. Closures make these functions more flexible and reusable, as they allow us to pass pre-configured functions with stored values."**
