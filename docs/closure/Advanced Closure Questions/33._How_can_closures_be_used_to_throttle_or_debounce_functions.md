# How can closures be used to throttle or debounce functions?

Closures play a crucial role in **throttling** and **debouncing** functions by **storing state** (like a timer or timestamp) across multiple calls. This helps control how often a function executes, improving performance in scenarios like **scrolling, resizing, API calls, and button clicks**.

## **1. What Are Throttling and Debouncing?**  

ðŸ”¹ **Throttling** ensures a function **executes at most once in a given time interval**, even if itâ€™s triggered multiple times. Useful for **scroll events, window resize, or rapid button clicks**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Debouncing** delays function execution **until after a certain time has passed** since the last event. Useful for **search input, autocomplete, or API calls**.  

âœ” **Both techniques use closures** to retain a timer or timestamp between function executions.

## **2. Implementing Throttling with Closures**  

Throttling **limits the rate** at which a function is executed by **keeping track of the last execution time**.

### âœ… **Throttle Function Using Closures**
```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let lastCall = 0; // Closure variable to store last execution time

    return function (...args) {
        const now = Date.now();
        if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
            lastCall = now; // Update last call time
            func.apply(this, args); // Execute function
        }
    };
}

// Example: Throttle scroll event
window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(() => {
    console.log("Throttled Scroll Event", Date.now());
}, 1000));
```
âœ” **The closure keeps track of `lastCall`** to prevent frequent function executions.  
âœ” Ensures the function **runs at most once every `limit` milliseconds**.  

---

## **3. Implementing Debouncing with Closures**  

Debouncing **delays execution** until the user stops triggering the event for a specified time.

### âœ… **Debounce Function Using Closures**
```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timer; // Closure variable to store timeout ID

    return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timer); // Clear previous timer
        timer = setTimeout(() => {
            func.apply(this, args); // Execute function
        }, delay);
    };
}

// Example: Debounce input event
const input = document.querySelector("#searchBox");
input.addEventListener("input", debounce(() => {
    console.log("Debounced API Call:", input.value);
}, 500));
```
âœ” **The closure retains `timer`**, resetting it on every input event.  
âœ” Ensures the function **executes only after the user stops typing**.

## **4. Real-World Use Cases of Throttling and Debouncing**
| Technique  | Use Cases |
|------------|----------|
| **Throttling** | Scroll events, resizing, infinite scrolling, rate-limiting API calls |
| **Debouncing** | Search inputs, form validation, resize handling, API calls |

## **5. Interview-Ready Answer**  
ðŸ’¡ **"Closures allow throttling and debouncing by storing state (like a timer or timestamp) across function calls. Throttling ensures a function executes at most once in a given time interval, while debouncing delays execution until after a certain period of inactivity. These techniques improve performance by reducing redundant executions of event-driven functions."**
