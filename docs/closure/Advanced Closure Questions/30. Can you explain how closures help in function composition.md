# Can you explain how closures help in function composition?

Closures play a crucial role in **function composition** by allowing functions to **retain access to variables from their outer scope**. This enables **partial application**, **currying**, and **creating reusable, modular functions**.

---

## **1. What is Function Composition?**  
**Function Composition** is the process of **combining two or more functions** to create a new function, where the **output of one function becomes the input of another**.

🔹 In mathematical notation:  
\[
f(g(x))
\]
🔹 In JavaScript:
```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));
```
✔️ This enables a **declarative and readable** approach to building complex functions.

## **2. How Closures Enable Function Composition**  
Closures **retain access** to variables from their outer function, making it possible to **chain functions together without losing intermediate values**.

### ✅ **Example: Function Composition with Closures**
```javascript
const add = (x) => (y) => x + y;
const multiply = (x) => (y) => x * y;

// Using closures to compose functions
const add2 = add(2); // Closure remembers `x = 2`
const multiply3 = multiply(3); // Closure remembers `x = 3`

console.log(add2(5)); // ✅ 7 (2 + 5)
console.log(multiply3(4)); // ✅ 12 (3 * 4)

// Composing functions
const add2ThenMultiply3 = (x) => multiply3(add2(x));
console.log(add2ThenMultiply3(5)); // ✅ 21 → (5 + 2) * 3
```
✔️ **`add(2)` retains `x = 2`** using a closure.  
✔️ **`multiply(3)` retains `x = 3`** using a closure.  
✔️ **Functions can be composed and reused efficiently**.

## **3. Function Composition Using a `compose` Utility**
Instead of manually composing functions, we can create a generic `compose` function.

### ✅ **Example: Generic Function Composition**
```javascript
const compose = (...functions) => (input) =>
    functions.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), input);

// Simple functions
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const square = (x) => x * x;
const addFive = (x) => x + 5;

// Compose multiple functions
const transform = compose(square, double, addFive);

console.log(transform(3)); // ✅ 64 → ((3 + 5) * 2)²
```
✔️ **Closures allow each function to retain its scope**.  
✔️ **Functions execute in reverse order (right to left)**.  

---

## **4. Real-World Use Case: Middleware in Express.js**
Closures are widely used in **middleware-based function composition**.

### ✅ **Example: Express Middleware Using Closures**
```javascript
const logger = (req) => (next) => {
    console.log(`Request received at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
    return next(req);
};

const authenticate = (req) => (next) => {
    if (!req.user) {
        throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    }
    return next(req);
};

// Middleware composition
const processRequest = compose(logger, authenticate);

try {
    processRequest({ user: "John" })(() => console.log("Processing request..."));
    // ✅ Logs timestamp and processes request
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
}
```
✔️ **Closures store `req` across functions**.  
✔️ **Functions execute in order while retaining access to earlier values**.

## **5. Interview-Ready Answer**
💡 **"Closures enable function composition by allowing functions to retain access to outer scope variables. This allows us to build reusable, modular functions where the output of one function serves as the input to another. Closures are commonly used in currying, middleware, and utility function chaining."**
