# Can you demonstrate a closure with a counter function?

A **counter function** is one of the most common examples of closures in JavaScript. It demonstrates how closures allow a function to maintain a **private state** across multiple function calls.

## **1. Basic Counter Using a Closure**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return function () {
        count++; // Increment count
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    };
}

const counter = createCounter(); // Create a new counter instance

counter(); // Output: Count: 1
counter(); // Output: Count: 2
counter(); // Output: Count: 3
```

### **Why Does This Work?**
✔️ The **inner function retains access** to `count`, even after `createCounter()` has executed.  
✔️ `count` is **not exposed globally**, making it private to the returned function.  
✔️ Each call to `counter()` **updates the same `count` variable** because it exists in the closure.

## **2. Counter with Increment, Decrement, and Reset**
We can enhance our counter by returning multiple functions to **increase, decrease, and reset** the count.

```javascript
function createAdvancedCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        },
        decrement: function () {
            count--;
            console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        },
        reset: function () {
            count = 0;
            console.log(`Counter reset to 0`);
        }
    };
}

const counter = createAdvancedCounter(); // Create a counter instance

counter.increment(); // Output: Count: 1
counter.increment(); // Output: Count: 2
counter.decrement(); // Output: Count: 1
counter.reset();     // Output: Counter reset to 0
```

### **Key Observations:**
✔️ The closure retains access to `count`, keeping it private.  
✔️ The returned object allows **controlled manipulation** of `count` without exposing it directly.  
✔️ Each function (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`) shares access to the same `count` variable.

## **3. Multiple Independent Counter Instances**
Each call to `createCounter()` creates a **new, independent counter instance**.

```javascript
const counter1 = createCounter();
const counter2 = createCounter();

counter1(); // Output: Count: 1
counter1(); // Output: Count: 2

counter2(); // Output: Count: 1 (Separate counter)
counter2(); // Output: Count: 2
```
✔️ `counter1` and `counter2` have **separate closures**, so their `count` variables are **independent**.

## **4. Interview-Ready Answer**
💡 **"A closure allows us to create a counter function where the count variable remains private and persists across function calls. This helps in encapsulating data and maintaining state. Each instance of the counter function has its own separate state, making closures a powerful concept in JavaScript for managing private variables and stateful behavior."**
