# What happens when you return a function inside another function?

When you return a function inside another function in JavaScript, a **closure** is created. This means that the returned function retains access to the variables from the outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

## **1. Basic Example: Returning a Function**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outerFunction";

    return function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    };
}

const myClosure = outerFunction(); // outerFunction executes, but its variable is retained
myClosure(); // Output: "I am from outerFunction"
```
### **What Happens Here?**
1Ô∏è‚É£ `outerFunction()` is called and **returns `innerFunction`**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ `innerFunction` is assigned to `myClosure`.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ When `myClosure()` is called, it **still has access** to `outerVariable`, even though `outerFunction` has already finished executing.  

‚úîÔ∏è This happens because **closures keep the variables alive in memory**, preventing them from being garbage collected.

## **2. Memory Retention & Closures**  
When a function is returned from another function, JavaScript **does not destroy the outer function‚Äôs variables** because the inner function still references them.

### **Example: Two Different Closures**
```javascript
function counter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function () {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter1 = counter();
const counter2 = counter();

counter1(); // Output: 1
counter1(); // Output: 2
counter2(); // Output: 1 (Different instance)
counter2(); // Output: 2
```
### **Key Observations:**
‚úîÔ∏è `counter1` and `counter2` **maintain separate `count` variables** because they each have a separate closure.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Even though `counter()` has finished execution, its variables persist** in memory due to closures.

## **3. Real-World Use Cases**
Returning a function inside another function is commonly used in:  
‚úÖ **Data Encapsulation (Private Variables)**  
‚úÖ **Event Handling**  
‚úÖ **Factory Functions**  
‚úÖ **Function Customization (Partial Application)**  
‚úÖ **Memoization (Performance Optimization)**

üí° **"When you return a function inside another function in JavaScript, a closure is created. This means that the returned function retains access to the outer function‚Äôs variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows for data encapsulation, state persistence, and function customization, making closures a powerful feature in JavaScript."**
