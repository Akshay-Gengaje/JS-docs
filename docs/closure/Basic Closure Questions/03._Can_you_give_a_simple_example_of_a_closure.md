# Can you give a simple example of a closure?

## **What is a Closure?**
A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that retains access to variables from its **outer function's scope**, even after the outer function has finished execution. Closures are a core concept of JavaScript and are made possible because of **lexical scoping**.

---

## **Simple Example of a Closure**
Let's consider a very simple closure example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outer scope";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); 
```

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**
### **1. Function Declaration**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outer scope";
```
- `outerFunction` is declared.
- Inside it, we define a variable `outerVariable` with the value `"I am from outer scope"`.

### **2. Inner Function (Closure)**
```javascript
function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
}
```
- Inside `outerFunction`, we declare `innerFunction`.
- `innerFunction` **accesses** the `outerVariable`, even though it is declared in `outerFunction`.

### **3. Returning the Inner Function**
```javascript
return innerFunction;
```
- Instead of calling `innerFunction` inside `outerFunction`, we **return it**.

### **4. Executing the Closure**
```javascript
const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction();
```
- `outerFunction()` is executed, returning `innerFunction`. The returned function is stored in `closureFunction`.
- Even though `outerFunction` **has already finished executing**, the returned `innerFunction` still **remembers** `outerVariable`.
- When we call `closureFunction()`, it logs:
  ```
  I am from outer scope
  ```

### **Why Does This Work?**
This works because of **closures**:
- When a function is created inside another function, it "remembers" variables from the outer function **even after the outer function has finished executing**.
- JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, meaning functions remember their original scope.

## **Visualizing Closure in Memory**
1. **First Execution (`outerFunction()`)**
   - `outerFunction` executes and creates:
     ```
     outerVariable = "I am from outer scope"
     ```
   - `innerFunction` is returned.

2. **After Execution of `outerFunction()`**
   - Normally, local variables would be destroyed.
   - But since `innerFunction` is still referencing `outerVariable`, JavaScript **keeps it in memory**.

3. **Executing `closureFunction()`**
   - Even though `outerFunction` has finished, `innerFunction` still has access to `outerVariable`.

---

## **Alternative Example: Counter with Closure**
A more practical use case of closures is a counter function:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function () {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
```

### **Why This Works?**
- `createCounter` runs once and initializes `count = 0`.
- The inner function is returned and stored in `counter`.
- Each time `counter()` is called, it **remembers** `count` and increments it.

## **Interview-Ready Answer**
ðŸ’¡ **"A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished execution. Closures allow functions to remember variables from their outer scope and are used for data encapsulation, maintaining state, and creating private variables. A simple example is a function that returns another function, which continues to access variables from the outer function even after execution."**
