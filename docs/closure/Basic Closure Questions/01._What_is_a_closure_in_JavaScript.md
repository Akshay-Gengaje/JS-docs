# What is a closure in JavaScript?

A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own **scope**, the **scope of the outer function**, and the **global scope**. This means that a closure can remember and access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. 

Closures are created **whenever a function is defined inside another function** and returned or assigned to a variable. They are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, enabling powerful techniques like **data encapsulation, function currying, and memoization**.

---

## **Understanding Closures with an Example**
Let's look at a simple example to illustrate how closures work:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
    };
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction("Hello");
closureFunction("World"); 
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. `outerFunction` is defined, taking an argument `outerVariable`.
2. Inside `outerFunction`, `innerFunction` is declared and returned.
3. When `outerFunction("Hello")` is executed, it returns `innerFunction`, but the important part is **it retains access to `outerVariable`**.
4. When `closureFunction("World")` is called, it still has access to `"Hello"` (stored in `outerVariable`), even though `outerFunction` has already finished executing.

**Output:**
```
Outer: Hello, Inner: World
```

## **Why Do Closures Work?**
Closures work due to **lexical scoping**, meaning a function remembers where it was created and retains access to variables in its parent scope. 

Even after the outer function finishes execution, the inner function **retains a reference to the variables it was closed over** rather than copying their values.

---

## **Practical Uses of Closures**
Closures are widely used in JavaScript for various scenarios:

### **1. Data Encapsulation (Private Variables)**
Closures allow us to create private variables that cannot be directly accessed from outside:

```javascript
function counter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        },
        decrement: function () {
            count--;
            console.log(count);
        }
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment(); // 1
myCounter.increment(); // 2
myCounter.decrement(); // 1
```
ðŸ”¹ Here, `count` is **not accessible directly**, ensuring data privacy.

---

### **2. Function Currying**
Closures help in currying, which means transforming a function with multiple parameters into a sequence of functions:

```javascript
function multiply(x) {
    return function (y) {
        return x * y;
    };
}

const double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```
ðŸ”¹ The `multiply` function retains access to `x`, even after execution.

---

### **3. Memoization (Caching)**
Closures help in **storing computed values** to optimize performance:

```javascript
function memoize() {
    let cache = {};
    return function (num) {
        if (num in cache) {
            console.log("Fetching from cache");
            return cache[num];
        } else {
            console.log("Calculating result");
            cache[num] = num * num;
            return cache[num];
        }
    };
}

const square = memoize();
console.log(square(5)); // Calculating result, 25
console.log(square(5)); // Fetching from cache, 25
```
ðŸ”¹ Here, `cache` remembers previous calculations using a closure.

## **Closures and Loops Issue**
One of the common issues with closures happens when using them inside loops. Consider:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

### **Output:**
```
3
3
3
```
**Why?**  
- Since `var` is function-scoped, all callbacks reference the same `i`, which has become `3` after the loop ends.

**Fix using `let` (block-scoped variables):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```
âœ… **Output:**
```
0
1
2
```

Another fix is using **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    (function (i) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(i);
        }, 1000);
    })(i);
}
```
âœ… This works because each IIFE call gets a fresh `i` value.

## **Common Mistakes with Closures**
1. **Memory Leaks:**  
   If closures hold references to large objects, they may prevent garbage collection.
   ```javascript
   function createClosure() {
       let largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill('data');
       return function () {
           console.log(largeArray.length);
       };
   }
   let closureFunc = createClosure();
   ```
   ðŸ”¹ If `closureFunc` is never reassigned, `largeArray` remains in memory.

2. **Unexpected Behavior in Loops:**  
   As seen earlier, using `var` inside loops causes unintended results.

3. **Accidentally Modifying a Shared Closure Variable:**
   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       let counter = 0;
       return function () {
           counter++;
           return counter;
       };
   }
   let first = outer();
   let second = outer();
   console.log(first()); // 1
   console.log(first()); // 2
   console.log(second()); // 1 (new closure, new counter)
   ```

## **Interview-Ready Answer**
ðŸ’¡ **"A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished execution. It allows us to create private variables, maintain state across function calls, and enable techniques like function currying and memoization. Closures work due to JavaScriptâ€™s lexical scoping and are widely used for data encapsulation and callback functions."**
