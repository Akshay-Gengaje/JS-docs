# How do closures work in JavaScript?

## **Introduction to Closures**
A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that has access to its **own scope**, the **scope of its outer function**, and the **global scope**. This means that even after the outer function has finished execution, the inner function still retains access to the variables declared in the outer function. 

Closures are created **whenever a function is defined inside another function and returned or assigned to a variable**. They allow for powerful programming techniques such as **data encapsulation, function currying, and memoization**.

---

## **Understanding Closures Through an Example**
Let's break down how closures work with a simple example:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log(`Outer: ${outerVariable}, Inner: ${innerVariable}`);
    };
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction("Hello");
closureFunction("World"); 
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. `outerFunction` is defined with a parameter `outerVariable`.
2. Inside `outerFunction`, `innerFunction` is declared and returned.
3. When `outerFunction("Hello")` is executed, it **returns `innerFunction`**, but the key point is:
   - `innerFunction` retains access to `outerVariable`, even though `outerFunction` has already executed.
4. When `closureFunction("World")` is called, it still has access to `"Hello"` stored in `outerVariable`.

**Output:**
```
Outer: Hello, Inner: World
```
This demonstrates how closures allow inner functions to "remember" variables from their parent scope.

## **Why Do Closures Work?**
Closures work because of **lexical scoping**, which means that a function **remembers the scope in which it was defined, not where it is executed**.

Even after the outer function has finished executing, the JavaScript engine **does not remove variables from memory** if they are still referenced by an inner function. This behavior is what enables closures.

---

## **How JavaScript Handles Closures in Memory**
When a function returns another function, JavaScript does **not** immediately remove the outer functionâ€™s variables from memory. Instead, it retains them in what is called a **closure scope**.

- The **JavaScript engine** uses a data structure known as the **scope chain** to maintain references to variables.
- If a variable is still referenced by an inner function, it remains in memory.

### **Example:**
```javascript
function counter() {
    let count = 0; // count is preserved in memory
    return function () {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter(); // 1
myCounter(); // 2
myCounter(); // 3
```

ðŸ”¹ Even though `counter()` has already executed, the variable `count` **persists in memory** because the inner function still references it.

## **Practical Applications of Closures**
Closures are incredibly useful in JavaScript and are commonly used in various scenarios:

### **1. Data Encapsulation (Creating Private Variables)**
Closures allow us to **hide** variables, preventing direct access from outside:

```javascript
function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
    let balance = initialBalance;
    
    return {
        deposit: function (amount) {
            balance += amount;
            console.log(`Deposited: ${amount}, Balance: ${balance}`);
        },
        withdraw: function (amount) {
            if (amount <= balance) {
                balance -= amount;
                console.log(`Withdrawn: ${amount}, Balance: ${balance}`);
            } else {
                console.log("Insufficient funds");
            }
        },
        getBalance: function () {
            console.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);
        }
    };
}

const myAccount = createBankAccount(100);
myAccount.deposit(50);   // Deposited: 50, Balance: 150
myAccount.withdraw(30);  // Withdrawn: 30, Balance: 120
myAccount.getBalance();  // Balance: 120
```

ðŸ”¹ Here, the variable `balance` **cannot be accessed directly** from outside, ensuring data security.

---

### **2. Function Currying**
Currying is a functional programming technique enabled by closures:

```javascript
function multiply(x) {
    return function (y) {
        return x * y;
    };
}

const double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
```

ðŸ”¹ The `multiply` function retains access to `x`, even after execution.

---

### **3. Memoization (Caching)**
Closures help in **caching computed values**, optimizing performance:

```javascript
function memoize() {
    let cache = {};
    return function (num) {
        if (cache[num] !== undefined) {
            console.log("Fetching from cache");
            return cache[num];
        } else {
            console.log("Calculating result");
            cache[num] = num * num;
            return cache[num];
        }
    };
}

const square = memoize();
console.log(square(5)); // Calculating result, 25
console.log(square(5)); // Fetching from cache, 25
```

ðŸ”¹ Here, `cache` remembers previous calculations using a closure.

## **Closures and Loops Issue**
A common mistake happens when closures are used in loops:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

### **Output:**
```
3
3
3
```
**Why?**  
Since `var` is function-scoped, all callbacks reference the same `i`, which has become `3` after the loop ends.

### **Fix using `let` (block-scoped variables):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```
âœ… **Output:**
```
0
1
2
```

Another fix is using **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):**
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    (function (i) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(i);
        }, 1000);
    })(i);
}
```
âœ… This works because each IIFE call gets a fresh `i` value.

## **Common Pitfalls of Closures**
1. **Memory Leaks:**  
   If closures reference large objects, they may **prevent garbage collection**.
   ```javascript
   function createClosure() {
       let largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill('data');
       return function () {
           console.log(largeArray.length);
       };
   }
   let closureFunc = createClosure();
   ```

2. **Accidentally Modifying a Shared Closure Variable:**
   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       let counter = 0;
       return function () {
           counter++;
           return counter;
       };
   }
   let first = outer();
   let second = outer();
   console.log(first()); // 1
   console.log(first()); // 2
   console.log(second()); // 1 (new closure, new counter)
   ```

## **Interview-Ready Answer**
ðŸ’¡ **"A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished execution. Closures are created when an inner function references variables from its outer function. They work because of JavaScriptâ€™s lexical scoping and are commonly used for data encapsulation, function currying, and memoization. Closures help maintain private state and enable callback-based programming."**
