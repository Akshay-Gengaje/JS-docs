# Why do we use closures?

## **What is a Closure?**
A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that retains access to variables from its **outer functionâ€™s scope**, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures work due to **lexical scoping**, meaning a function "remembers" the scope in which it was created.

---

## **Why Do We Use Closures?**
Closures are incredibly powerful and are used for various programming techniques. Below are the main reasons why we use closures in JavaScript:

### **1. Data Encapsulation & Private Variables**
One of the most common uses of closures is **creating private variables** that cannot be accessed directly from outside the function.

#### **Example: Creating a Private Counter**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return {
        increment: function () {
            count++;
            console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        },
        decrement: function () {
            count--;
            console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
        },
        getCount: function () {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // Count: 1
counter.increment(); // Count: 2
counter.decrement(); // Count: 1
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // Undefined (cannot be accessed directly)
```
### **Why It Works?**
- The variable `count` is **private** because it's inside the closure.
- It can only be modified through `increment()`, `decrement()`, and `getCount()`, preventing accidental changes.

---

### **2. Function Factories (Generating Functions Dynamically)**
Closures allow us to **create dynamic functions** with pre-configured values.

#### **Example: Function Factory for Multiplication**
```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function (number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15
```

### **Why It Works?**
- `double` remembers that `factor = 2`.
- `triple` remembers that `factor = 3`.
- Each function **retains its own closure scope**, preventing interference.

---

### **3. Function Currying**
Closures are useful for **currying**, which transforms a function with multiple parameters into a sequence of functions.

#### **Example: Currying**
```javascript
function sum(a) {
    return function (b) {
        return function (c) {
            return a + b + c;
        };
    };
}

console.log(sum(2)(3)(4)); // 9
```
### **Why It Works?**
- Each function **remembers its previous arguments** (`a`, `b`, `c`).
- It makes function calls more flexible and reusable.

---

### **4. Memoization (Caching Results for Performance Optimization)**
Closures help store **previously computed values**, improving efficiency.

#### **Example: Caching Expensive Computations**
```javascript
function memoize() {
    let cache = {};

    return function (num) {
        if (num in cache) {
            console.log("Fetching from cache");
            return cache[num];
        } else {
            console.log("Calculating result");
            cache[num] = num * num;
            return cache[num];
        }
    };
}

const square = memoize();
console.log(square(5)); // Calculating result, 25
console.log(square(5)); // Fetching from cache, 25
```
### **Why It Works?**
- The `cache` object **persists in memory** due to the closure.
- The second call to `square(5)` retrieves the result from the cache instead of recomputing it.

---

### **5. Maintaining State in Asynchronous Operations**
Closures help retain state across **setTimeout, setInterval, and event handlers**.

#### **Example: Closures with setTimeout**
```javascript
function createTimer() {
    let count = 0;
    
    return function () {
        setTimeout(() => {
            count++;
            console.log(`Timer Count: ${count}`);
        }, 1000);
    };
}

const timer = createTimer();
timer(); // Timer Count: 1 (after 1 second)
timer(); // Timer Count: 2 (after 1 second)
```
### **Why It Works?**
- The inner function **remembers `count`**, even after `createTimer()` has finished executing.

---

### **6. Fixing `var` Issues in Loops**
Closures help **preserve values in loops** when using `var`.

#### **Issue Without Closures**
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```
**Output (unexpected):**
```
3
3
3
```
**Why?**
- `var` is function-scoped, so all callbacks reference the final value of `i` (`3`).

#### **Fix Using Closures**
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    (function (i) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(i);
        }, 1000);
    })(i);
}
```
**Output (expected):**
```
0
1
2
```
### **Why It Works?**
- The **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** creates a **new closure** for each loop iteration, preserving `i`.

## **Common Mistakes with Closures**
1. **Memory Leaks**
   - If closures retain references to large objects, they **prevent garbage collection**.
   ```javascript
   function createClosure() {
       let largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill('data');
       return function () {
           console.log(largeArray.length);
       };
   }
   let closureFunc = createClosure();
   ```
   **Fix:** Manually nullify large references when no longer needed.

2. **Unintended Shared State**
   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       let count = 0;
       return function () {
           count++;
           return count;
       };
   }
   let first = outer();
   let second = outer();
   console.log(first()); // 1
   console.log(first()); // 2
   console.log(second()); // 1 (new closure, new counter)
   ```
