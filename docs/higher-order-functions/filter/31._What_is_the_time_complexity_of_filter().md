# What is the time complexity of filter()?

The **`filter()`** method iterates through each element in an array and applies a callback function to determine whether to include that element in the new array.  

### **âœ… Time Complexity of `filter()`**
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`** (linear time)  
- **Why?**  
  - `filter()` processes **each element once** in the array.  
  - It **does not perform nested loops**.  

---

### **âœ… Breakdown of `filter()` Complexity**
- **Best Case (`O(n)`)**: Even if no elements pass the test, `filter()` still loops through all `n` elements.
- **Worst Case (`O(n)`)**: If every element passes, it still checks all `n` elements before creating a new array.
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`** (in the worst case, where all elements are included in the new array).

### **âœ… Example 1: `filter()` Iterating Over an Array**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evens);  
// âœ… Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
âœ” **Each element is checked once**, making the time complexity **O(n)**.

### **âœ… Example 2: `filter()` on an Array of Objects**
```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 17 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 30 }
];

const adults = users.filter(user => user.age >= 18);

console.log(adults);  
// âœ… Output: [{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }, { name: "Charlie", age: 30 }]
```
âœ” Still **O(n)** because it checks each object once.

### **âœ… How Does `filter()` Compare to Other Array Methods?**
| Method     | Time Complexity | Purpose |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| `filter()`  | **O(n)**  | Filters elements based on a condition |
| `map()`     | **O(n)**  | Transforms each element |
| `reduce()`  | **O(n)**  | Accumulates values |
| `forEach()` | **O(n)**  | Iterates without returning a new array |
| `sort()`    | **O(n log n)**  | Sorting elements |

### **ðŸ“Œ Interview-Ready Answer**  
ðŸ’¡ **"`filter()` has a time complexity of `O(n)`, meaning it iterates over each element once. The performance is linear because it applies a condition to each element before returning a new filtered array. Itâ€™s efficient for filtering but should be used carefully in nested loops to avoid performance issues."**
