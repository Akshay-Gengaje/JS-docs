# How do you filter an array of objects based on a specific property value?

The **`filter()` method** in JavaScript is commonly used to filter an array of objects based on a specific property value. It returns a **new array** containing only the objects that satisfy the given condition.

---

## **âœ… Example 1: Filtering Objects by a Specific Property Value**
Let's say we have an array of users and we want to filter out only the **active users**.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, active: true },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, active: false },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, active: true }
];

const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.active);

console.log(activeUsers);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, active: true },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, active: true }
]
*/
```
âœ” The `filter()` method checks if `user.active` is `true` and **returns only the matching objects**.

## **âœ… Example 2: Filtering Objects Based on a String Property**
Suppose we need to filter **users with the role of "admin"**.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", role: "admin" },
  { name: "Bob", role: "user" },
  { name: "Charlie", role: "admin" }
];

const admins = users.filter(user => user.role === "admin");

console.log(admins);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Alice", role: "admin" },
  { name: "Charlie", role: "admin" }
]
*/
```
âœ” Only objects where `user.role === "admin"` are included in the new array.

---

## **âœ… Example 3: Filtering Objects Based on a Numerical Range**
Let's filter users who are **30 years or older**.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
];

const olderUsers = users.filter(user => user.age >= 30);

console.log(olderUsers);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
]
*/
```
âœ” The condition `user.age >= 30` keeps only users **30 or older**.

---

## **âœ… Example 4: Case-Insensitive Filtering**
If we want to filter users by **case-insensitive names**, we can convert both strings to lowercase.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice" },
  { name: "Bob" },
  { name: "Charlie" }
];

const searchTerm = "bob"; // User input

const matchedUsers = users.filter(user => user.name.toLowerCase() === searchTerm.toLowerCase());

console.log(matchedUsers);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Bob" }
]
*/
```
âœ” This makes sure `"Bob"` matches `"bob"` even with different cases.

---

## **âœ… Example 5: Filtering Objects Where a Property is an Array**
If we have objects where a property is an array (e.g., `tags`), we can filter based on **whether an element exists in that array**.

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", tags: ["electronics", "computers"] },
  { name: "Shirt", tags: ["clothing", "fashion"] },
  { name: "Phone", tags: ["electronics", "mobile"] }
];

const electronics = products.filter(product => product.tags.includes("electronics"));

console.log(electronics);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Laptop", tags: ["electronics", "computers"] },
  { name: "Phone", tags: ["electronics", "mobile"] }
]
*/
```
âœ” The `.includes("electronics")` method checks if `"electronics"` is in the `tags` array.

ðŸ’¡ **"To filter an array of objects based on a specific property, use the `filter()` method with a callback function that checks the desired condition. For example, `array.filter(obj => obj.property === value)` returns a new array containing only the matching objects. This technique is commonly used for filtering users, products, or search results dynamically."**
