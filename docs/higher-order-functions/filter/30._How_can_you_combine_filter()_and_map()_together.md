# How can you combine filter() and map() together?

In JavaScript, **`filter()` and `map()`** can be combined to first filter elements based on a condition and then transform them. This approach is useful for working with **arrays of numbers, strings, or objects** efficiently.

---

## **âœ… How Does `filter()` and `map()` Work Together?**
1. **`filter()`**: Selects elements based on a condition.
2. **`map()`**: Transforms the filtered elements.

### **Example Flow**
```javascript
const result = array.filter(condition).map(transformation);
```

## **âœ… Example 1: Filtering Even Numbers and Doubling Them**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const doubledEvens = numbers
  .filter(num => num % 2 === 0)  // Keep only even numbers
  .map(num => num * 2);          // Double the remaining numbers

console.log(doubledEvens);
// âœ… Output: [4, 8, 12]
```
âœ” `filter()` keeps **[2, 4, 6]**, and `map()` doubles them to **[4, 8, 12]**.

## **âœ… Example 2: Filtering Active Users and Extracting Names**
```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "Alice", active: true },
  { name: "Bob", active: false },
  { name: "Charlie", active: true }
];

const activeUserNames = users
  .filter(user => user.active)  // Keep only active users
  .map(user => user.name);      // Extract their names

console.log(activeUserNames);
// âœ… Output: ["Alice", "Charlie"]
```
âœ” `filter()` removes **inactive users**, and `map()` extracts **names of active users**.

---

## **âœ… Example 3: Filtering Products by Price and Extracting Names**
```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1200 },
  { name: "Phone", price: 800 },
  { name: "Mouse", price: 50 }
];

const expensiveProducts = products
  .filter(product => product.price > 500)  // Keep only expensive products
  .map(product => product.name);           // Extract product names

console.log(expensiveProducts);
// âœ… Output: ["Laptop", "Phone"]
```
âœ” Only `Laptop` and `Phone` remain after filtering, and their **names** are extracted.

---

## **âœ… Example 4: Filtering Students with High Scores and Calculating Percentages**
```javascript
const students = [
  { name: "Alice", score: 85 },
  { name: "Bob", score: 40 },
  { name: "Charlie", score: 90 }
];

const topStudents = students
  .filter(student => student.score >= 60)  // Keep students with score >= 60
  .map(student => ({
    name: student.name,
    percentage: (student.score / 100) * 100 + "%"  // Convert to percentage
  }));

console.log(topStudents);
/* âœ… Output:
[
  { name: "Alice", percentage: "85%" },
  { name: "Charlie", percentage: "90%" }
]
*/
```
âœ” Students with **low scores** are filtered out, and the rest are transformed.

## **ðŸ“Œ Interview-Ready Answer**  
ðŸ’¡ **"To combine `filter()` and `map()`, first use `filter()` to select elements based on a condition, then use `map()` to transform the filtered elements. For example, filtering active users and extracting their names: `array.filter(condition).map(transformation)`. This makes code cleaner and more efficient."**
