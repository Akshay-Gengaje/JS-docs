# How does eval() work with functions?

The `eval()` function **executes a string** as JavaScript code. It can be used to define and invoke functions dynamically, but it is **highly discouraged** due to security and performance risks.  

---

## **✅ 1. Defining a Function with `eval()`**
You can use `eval()` to **dynamically create a function** from a string.

```javascript
eval("function greet(name) { return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'; }");

console.log(greet("Alice")); // ✅ "Hello, Alice!"
```
📌 **How it works?**  
- The `eval()` function parses the string **as if it was JavaScript code**.  
- The `greet` function is defined **globally** and can be used like a normal function.  

---

## **✅ 2. Executing Anonymous Functions with `eval()`**
You can also create and execute **anonymous functions** using `eval()`.

```javascript
const result = eval("(function(a, b) { return a + b; })(3, 5)");
console.log(result); // ✅ 8
```
📌 **How it works?**  
- The function is **wrapped in parentheses** so that `eval()` returns its result.  
- It is **immediately invoked** with `(3, 5)`.  

✔ **Useful for dynamic calculations.**

## **❌ 3. Why `eval()` is Dangerous and Should Be Avoided**  
### **🚨 Security Risk (Code Injection)**
If `eval()` processes user input, **malicious code** can be executed.

```javascript
const userInput = "console.log('Hacked!');";
eval(userInput); // ❌ Dangerous! Could execute any JS code
```
**❗ Avoid using `eval()` with external inputs.**  

---

### **🐌 Performance Issues**
- `eval()` forces JavaScript to **recompile the code at runtime**.  
- It **bypasses optimizations**, making execution **slower**.  

---

## **✅ Safer Alternatives**
### **🔹 Using `new Function()` (Safer Alternative)**
Instead of `eval()`, use `new Function()` for dynamic function creation.

```javascript
const add = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b;");
console.log(add(3, 5)); // ✅ 8
```
📌 **Why is this safer?**  
✔ **Encapsulated scope** (does not pollute global scope).  
✔ **No variable injection risks** (unlike `eval()`).  
✔ **Faster execution** (optimizable by JavaScript engines).  

---

## **🚀 Key Takeaways**
✔ `eval()` can **define and execute functions dynamically**, but it is risky.  
✔ It can lead to **security vulnerabilities** (code injection).  
✔ It has **performance issues** due to runtime compilation.  
✔ Use **`new Function()`** instead for dynamic function creation.
