# What is the output of?

Let's analyze the given JavaScript code:

```javascript
function foo() {} 
var foo = 10; 
console.log(typeof foo);
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Function Declaration Hoisting**  
   ```javascript
   function foo() {}
   ```
   - Function declarations are **hoisted** to the top of their scope.  
   - The function `foo` is created in memory before execution starts.

2. **Variable Declaration Hoisting**  
   ```javascript
   var foo = 10;
   ```
   - `var` declarations are **hoisted**, but only their declaration, **not their assignment**.
   - This means JavaScript first **declares `foo`**, but does not assign `10` to it until execution reaches that line.

3. **Overwriting the Function `foo` with a Number (`10`)**  
   - When `var foo = 10;` executes, `foo` (which was previously a function) is now **assigned the value `10`**.

4. **Executing `typeof foo`**  
   - At this point, `foo` holds `10`, which is a number.  
   - `typeof 10` returns **"number"**.

### **Final Output:**
```javascript
console.log(typeof foo); // "number"
```

### **‚úÖ Summary of Hoisting Behavior:**
The code behaves as if rewritten like this:
```javascript
// Hoisting result
var foo; // Declaration is hoisted (but not the assignment)

function foo() {} // Function declaration is hoisted (overwriting var foo)

foo = 10; // The function foo is overwritten by the number 10

console.log(typeof foo); // "number"
```
‚úî **Functions declared with `function` are hoisted first.**  
‚úî **Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, but their values are assigned later.**  
‚úî **The variable assignment (`foo = 10`) overwrites the function reference.**

---

### **üîπ What If We Used `let` or `const` Instead of `var`?**
```javascript
function foo() {}
let foo = 10; // ‚ùå SyntaxError: Identifier 'foo' has already been declared
```
‚úî `let` and `const` **do not allow redeclaration**, so this would cause an error.

### **üöÄ Key Takeaways:**
1. **Function declarations are hoisted before `var` declarations.**  
2. **`var` declarations do not override function declarations, but assignments do.**  
3. **The last assigned value (`foo = 10`) determines the final type (`number`).**

üòä **Final Answer:** `"number"`
