# What is tail recursion, and does JavaScript support it?

## **✅ What is Tail Recursion?**  
**Tail recursion** is a type of **recursion** where the recursive call is the **last operation** performed before returning a value. This allows optimizations to be applied, reducing memory usage.  

📌 **Example of Regular Recursion (Not Tail Recursive)**  
```javascript
function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // ❌ Not Tail Recursive (Multiplication happens after recursion)
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
### **🔴 Problem with Regular Recursion:**  
Each recursive call **creates a new stack frame**, increasing memory usage, which can lead to **stack overflow errors**.

---

## **✅ Tail Recursive Function Example**  
A **tail recursive function** ensures the recursive call **is the last operation**, allowing optimizations.

```javascript
function factorialTailRecursive(n, acc = 1) {
    if (n === 1) return acc;
    return factorialTailRecursive(n - 1, n * acc); // ✅ Tail Recursive (No extra calculations after recursion)
}

console.log(factorialTailRecursive(5)); // Output: 120
```
### **✅ Key Features of Tail Recursion:**
✔ **Recursive call is the last operation** before returning.  
✔ Uses an **accumulator (`acc`)** to store intermediate results.  
✔ Allows **Tail Call Optimization (TCO)** in some environments.

## **✅ Does JavaScript Support Tail Call Optimization (TCO)?**
🔹 **TCO (Tail Call Optimization)** is an optimization where the JavaScript engine **reuses** the current stack frame for a tail-recursive call instead of creating a new one.  

🔹 **ES6 introduced TCO, but it is only supported in strict mode and in some JavaScript engines.**  

```javascript
"use strict";
function tailRecursiveSum(n, acc = 0) {
    if (n === 0) return acc;
    return tailRecursiveSum(n - 1, acc + n);
}

console.log(tailRecursiveSum(5)); // Output: 15
```
### **🚀 BUT...**
❌ **Most modern JavaScript engines (V8, used in Chrome & Node.js) DO NOT support TCO**, meaning **tail-recursive functions still use additional stack frames**.  
✔ **Safari (JavaScriptCore engine) supports TCO** in strict mode.  

---

## **✅ When to Use Tail Recursion?**
🔹 **For large recursive operations** (factorial, Fibonacci, sum calculations, etc.).  
🔹 **When optimizing memory usage** (if TCO is supported).  
🔹 **As an alternative to loops** in functional programming.

## **🚀 Summary**
| **Feature** | **Regular Recursion** | **Tail Recursion** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Stack Usage** | Uses a new stack frame per call | Can reuse the same stack frame (if TCO is supported) |
| **Performance** | More memory usage | More efficient (in engines with TCO) |
| **Support in JavaScript** | Fully supported everywhere | TCO only in Safari (not in V8 - Chrome, Node.js) |
| **Best Practice** | Use for simple recursive functions | Use for large recursive functions (if TCO is supported) |
