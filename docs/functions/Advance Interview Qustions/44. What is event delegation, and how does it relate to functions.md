# What is event delegation, and how does it relate to functions?

## **🔹 What is Event Delegation?**  
Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a **single event listener** is added to a **parent element** instead of attaching separate listeners to multiple child elements. The parent element then listens for events that bubble up from its children and **handles them conditionally**.

### **✅ Why Use Event Delegation?**  
✔ **Improves performance**: Avoids adding multiple event listeners.  
✔ **Handles dynamic elements**: Works even if elements are added later.  
✔ **Simplifies code**: Keeps event handling logic in one place.

## **🔹 How Event Delegation Works**
### **🚫 Without Delegation (Inefficient)**
```javascript
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll(".btn");
buttons.forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button clicked!");
    });
});
```
❌ **Issues**:  
- Adds a separate event listener for each `.btn` element.  
- Doesn’t work for dynamically added buttons.

### **✅ With Event Delegation (Efficient)**
```javascript
document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    if (event.target.classList.contains("btn")) {
        console.log("Button clicked!");
    }
});
```
✔ **Fixes:**  
- **Only one event listener** is attached to `#parent`.  
- **Works for dynamically added `.btn` elements**.  
- **Uses event bubbling** to capture child events at the parent level.

## **🔹 How Event Delegation Relates to Functions**
1. **Higher-Order Functions**:  
   - Event delegation often uses **functions as event handlers**.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function handleClick(event) {
         if (event.target.classList.contains("btn")) {
             console.log("Button clicked!");
         }
     }
     document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
     ```

2. **Event Bubbling**:  
   - Delegation relies on **event bubbling**, where events **propagate upwards** from the target element to its ancestors.

3. **Function Optimization**:  
   - Instead of adding multiple functions for each child element, **one function** handles all child elements efficiently.

## **🔹 When to Use Event Delegation?**
✅ **Handling lists, tables, or menus with many items**  
✅ **Handling dynamically created elements**  
✅ **Reducing memory usage by minimizing event listeners**
