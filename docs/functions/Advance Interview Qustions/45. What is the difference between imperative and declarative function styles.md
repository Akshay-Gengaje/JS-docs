# What is the difference between imperative and declarative function styles?

## **1️⃣ What is Imperative Programming?**  
🔹 **Imperative programming** focuses on **how** a task is performed by explicitly defining each step in a sequence of commands. It involves **detailed control flow**, often using loops and conditionals.

### **✅ Characteristics of Imperative Code**
✔ Step-by-step instructions  
✔ Uses loops (`for`, `while`) and mutations  
✔ Focuses on **how** things happen  

### **🚀 Example: Summing an Array (Imperative Style)**
```javascript
function sumArray(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 15
```
📌 **Explanation**:  
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the array.  
- **Manually updates** the `sum` variable.  
- Explicitly tells the computer **how** to perform the task.

## **2️⃣ What is Declarative Programming?**  
🔹 **Declarative programming** focuses on **what** needs to be done, rather than specifying the exact steps to do it. It often uses **higher-order functions** like `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()`.

### **✅ Characteristics of Declarative Code**
✔ Focuses on **what** should happen, not how  
✔ Uses built-in functions (`map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()`)  
✔ More **concise** and **readable**  

### **🚀 Example: Summing an Array (Declarative Style)**
```javascript
const sumArray = arr => arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 15
```
📌 **Explanation**:  
- Uses `reduce()` to handle summing.  
- No explicit looping or variable mutation.  
- **More readable & maintainable**.

## **3️⃣ Key Differences Between Imperative and Declarative Styles**
| Feature              | Imperative Style                        | Declarative Style                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Describes **how** to achieve a task | Describes **what** needs to be done |
| **Code Structure**   | Uses loops, conditions, and mutations | Uses built-in functions & expressions |
| **Readability**      | More verbose and detailed            | More concise and readable        |
| **Performance**      | Can be optimized for specific cases  | May rely on function calls (slightly slower) |
| **Examples**         | `for` loops, `if-else` statements    | `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()` |

## **4️⃣ When to Use Imperative vs. Declarative Style?**
✅ **Use Imperative** when you need **fine control** over execution (e.g., performance-heavy loops).  
✅ **Use Declarative** for **readability and maintainability** (e.g., array operations, functional programming).  

💡 **In modern JavaScript, declarative functions are preferred for cleaner, more maintainable code.** 🚀
