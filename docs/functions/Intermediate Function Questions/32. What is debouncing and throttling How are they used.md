# What is debouncing and throttling? How are they used?

Debouncing and throttling are **optimization techniques** used to control the rate at which a function is executed, especially in scenarios like scrolling, resizing, and typing events. They help improve **performance** by **reducing unnecessary function calls**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ What is Debouncing?**  

ðŸ“Œ **Debouncing ensures that a function runs only after a specified delay, and resets the timer if the function is called again before the delay expires.**  
ðŸ“Œ It is useful for handling **rapidly occurring events**, like:
   - **Search input suggestions** (wait until the user stops typing).  
   - **Resizing the window** (trigger logic after user stops resizing).  
   - **Button click prevention** (avoid multiple clicks).  

### **âœ” Example: Debouncing a Search Input**
```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timer;
    return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timer); // Clear the previous timer
        timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay); // Set a new timer
    };
}

// Function to simulate an API request
function fetchResults(query) {
    console.log(`Fetching results for: ${query}`);
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(fetchResults, 500);

document.getElementById("searchBox").addEventListener("input", (event) => {
    debouncedSearch(event.target.value);
});
```
âœ… **How It Works?**  
- Every time the user types, the function **waits 500ms before executing**.  
- If the user **keeps typing**, the timer **resets**.  
- The function executes **only when the user stops typing**.

## **ðŸ”¹ What is Throttling?**  

ðŸ“Œ **Throttling ensures that a function is executed at most once in a specified time interval, even if it is triggered multiple times.**  
ðŸ“Œ It is useful for handling **frequent events**, like:
   - **Window scrolling** (running code every 200ms instead of every pixel change).  
   - **Mouse movement events** (reducing frequent updates).  
   - **Button click spam prevention** (limiting button clicks).  

### **âœ” Example: Throttling a Scroll Event**
```javascript
function throttle(func, interval) {
    let lastTime = 0;
    return function (...args) {
        let now = Date.now();
        if (now - lastTime >= interval) {
            func.apply(this, args);
            lastTime = now;
        }
    };
}

// Function to execute on scroll
function handleScroll() {
    console.log("Scroll event triggered");
}

// Apply throttling to the scroll event
window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(handleScroll, 200));
```
âœ… **How It Works?**  
- The function executes **once every 200ms**, no matter how often scrolling happens.  
- Even if the event is triggered multiple times, it **only executes at fixed intervals**.

## **ðŸ”¹ Debouncing vs Throttling: Key Differences**
| Feature       | Debouncing | Throttling |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Definition** | Delays function execution until after a specified time has passed since the last call | Ensures function executes at most once in a given time interval |
| **Use Cases** | Typing events, resizing, search autocomplete | Scrolling, mouse movement, API rate limiting |
| **Behavior** | Executes **once** after the user stops triggering the event | Executes **at fixed intervals** while the event is triggered |
| **Example** | Auto-search feature (wait until user stops typing) | Scroll event handler (execute every 200ms) |

---

## **ðŸ”¹ When to Use What?**
| Scenario | Debounce or Throttle? | Why? |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| **Typing in a search box** | **Debounce** | Waits until the user stops typing to avoid unnecessary API calls. |
| **Handling window resize** | **Debounce** | Executes logic only when the user stops resizing. |
| **Scroll event (e.g., infinite scroll, lazy loading)** | **Throttle** | Prevents excessive function calls while scrolling. |
| **Button clicks (prevent multiple clicks)** | **Throttle** | Ensures the button is clicked only once in a time interval. |
| **Mouse movement tracking** | **Throttle** | Reduces function execution frequency to improve performance. |

## **ðŸ”¹ Conclusion**
âœ” **Debouncing** postpones function execution until after a delay (useful for **typing, resizing**).  
âœ” **Throttling** limits function execution to fixed intervals (useful for **scrolling, mouse movement**).  
âœ” Both **improve performance** and prevent excessive function calls in event-heavy applications.
