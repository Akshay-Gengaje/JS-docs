# What is closure in JavaScript? Can you give an example?

# **ðŸ”¹ Closures in JavaScript (In-Depth Explanation)**  

## **ðŸ”¹ What is a Closure?**  
A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that **remembers the variables from its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope**.

ðŸ“Œ **In simple terms:**  
- A function **inside another function** that **remembers variables** from the parent function.  
- Even if the parent function **finishes execution**, the inner function **retains access** to its variables.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Basic Closure**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I am from outerFunction";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // âœ… Accessing outerVariable
    }

    return innerFunction; // Returning the function instead of calling it
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction(); // outerFunction runs and returns innerFunction
closureFunction(); // Output: I am from outerFunction
```
### **âœ” Explanation**
1. **`outerFunction()` runs** and creates `outerVariable`.
2. **It returns `innerFunction`**, without calling it.
3. **Even though `outerFunction()` has finished executing, `closureFunction` still has access to `outerVariable`.**
4. **Why?** Because of **closure**, `innerFunction()` remembers the scope where it was created.

## **ðŸ”¹ Why Are Closures Needed?**
Closures **help retain state** and **encapsulate private variables**. They are useful for:  
âœ… **Data encapsulation** (private variables).  
âœ… **Creating function factories** (dynamic functions).  
âœ… **Maintaining state** in functions.  
âœ… **Event handling and callbacks**.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Closure for Data Encapsulation (Private Variables)**
```javascript
function counter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return function() {
        count++; // Modifies private variable
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const increment = counter();
increment(); // Output: 1
increment(); // Output: 2
increment(); // Output: 3
```
### **âœ” Why Does This Work?**
- **`count` is private** to `counter()`, meaning no one can modify it directly.
- The inner function **remembers `count`** even after `counter()` has executed.
- Every time `increment()` is called, `count` **persists and increases**.

ðŸ“Œ **ðŸ”¹ Use Closures to Create Private Variables**  
Closures **prevent accidental modification** of variables by other parts of the program.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example 3: Closures for Function Factories**
Closures help **generate dynamic functions**.

```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function(number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```
### **âœ” Explanation**
- `multiplyBy(2)` returns a function that multiplies by `2` â†’ **stored in `double`**.
- `multiplyBy(3)` returns a function that multiplies by `3` â†’ **stored in `triple`**.
- Both functions **retain access to their `factor` variable** even after `multiplyBy()` has finished.

ðŸ“Œ **ðŸ”¹ Use Closures to Create Customizable Functions**  
Closures help generate **specific functions from a generic one**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example 4: Closures in Event Listeners**
Closures help retain state in **event handlers**.

```javascript
function createButtonLogger(buttonId) {
    let count = 0;

    document.getElementById(buttonId).addEventListener("click", function() {
        count++;
        console.log(`Button ${buttonId} clicked ${count} times`);
    });
}

createButtonLogger("myButton");
```
### **âœ” Explanation**
- Each button click **increases `count`** and remembers the previous count.
- The event listener **remembers `count`** due to closure.

ðŸ“Œ **ðŸ”¹ Use Closures for State Retention in Event Handlers**  
Closures allow event listeners to **remember past interactions**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example 5: Closures in Asynchronous Code (setTimeout)**
```javascript
function delayedMessage(message, delay) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(message);
    }, delay);
}

delayedMessage("Hello, after 2 seconds!", 2000);
```
### **âœ” Explanation**
- The inner function **remembers `message`** even after `delayedMessage()` has finished.
- When `setTimeout` executes after 2 seconds, it **still has access to `message`**.

ðŸ“Œ **ðŸ”¹ Use Closures in Asynchronous Code**  
Closures **keep track of variables in delayed functions** like `setTimeout`.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ When to Use Closures?**
| **Use Case**              | **Why Use Closures?** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Data Privacy** | Keep variables private inside a function. |
| **Function Factories** | Create dynamic functions that remember values. |
| **State Persistence** | Remember values between function calls. |
| **Event Handlers** | Store data within event callbacks. |
| **Asynchronous Code** | Retain variables in `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`. |

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Final Thoughts**
âœ… **Closures allow functions to "remember" variables even after execution.**  
âœ… **They help encapsulate private variables and manage state.**  
âœ… **Closures are useful in function factories, event handlers, and async operations.**
