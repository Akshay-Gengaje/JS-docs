# What is lexical scope in JavaScript?

**Lexical scope** (also known as **static scope**) in JavaScript refers to how **variables are resolved in nested functions** based on their **position in the code**. This means:
- **A function can access variables from its parent scope** (where it was defined).
- **Functions cannot access variables from child functions**.
- The scope chain is **determined at compile time**, not runtime.

üìå **Key Rule:** **Inner functions can access variables of their outer functions, but not vice versa.**

---

## **üîπ Example 1: Understanding Lexical Scope**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVar = "I am from outerFunction";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ Can access outerVar due to lexical scope
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```
### **‚úî Explanation:**
1. `outerVar` is declared inside `outerFunction()`.
2. `innerFunction()` is **nested inside `outerFunction()`**, so it **inherits** its scope.
3. When `innerFunction()` is called, it **looks for `outerVar`**:
   - First, it checks its own scope ‚Üí ‚ùå Not found.
   - Then, it looks in `outerFunction()`'s scope ‚Üí ‚úÖ Found!
4. This behavior is called **lexical scope**.

---

## **üîπ Example 2: Variables Are Not Accessible in Reverse**
```javascript
function outer() {
    let outerVar = "Outer Variable";

    function inner() {
        let innerVar = "Inner Variable";
        console.log(outerVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible
        console.log(innerVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible
    }

    inner();
    console.log(innerVar); // ‚ùå ReferenceError (outer cannot access inner's scope)
}

outer();
```
### **‚ùå Why Does `console.log(innerVar);` Fail?**
- **Outer functions CANNOT access inner function variables**.
- The **scope chain only works downward, not upward**.

---

## **üîπ Example 3: Scope Chain (Multiple Nested Functions)**
```javascript
function grandparent() {
    let grandparentVar = "I am from grandparent";

    function parent() {
        let parentVar = "I am from parent";

        function child() {
            let childVar = "I am from child";

            console.log(grandparentVar); // ‚úÖ Accessible (via lexical scope)
            console.log(parentVar);      // ‚úÖ Accessible (via lexical scope)
            console.log(childVar);       // ‚úÖ Accessible (inside child function)
        }

        child();
    }

    parent();
}

grandparent();
```
### **‚úî Scope Chain Flow:**
1. **`child()` searches for `grandparentVar`**:
   - It first looks in its **own scope** ‚Üí ‚ùå Not found.
   - It then looks in **`parent()`** ‚Üí ‚ùå Not found.
   - It finally finds it in **`grandparent()`** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works!

2. **Lexical scope follows a strict hierarchy:**
   - **`child()` can access `parentVar` and `grandparentVar`.**
   - **`parent()` can access `grandparentVar` but not `childVar`.**
   - **`grandparent()` cannot access any child variables.**

---

## **üîπ Example 4: Lexical Scope with Closures**
A **closure** is a function that remembers its **lexical scope** even when executed outside its original scope.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let count = 0;

    return function innerFunction() {
        count++;
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    };
}

const counter = outerFunction(); // Returns innerFunction but keeps `count` alive
counter(); // Count: 1
counter(); // Count: 2
```
### **‚úî Explanation:**
- `innerFunction()` **remembers the `count` variable**, even after `outerFunction()` has finished executing.
- This is possible because of **lexical scoping**, which allows `innerFunction()` to retain access to `count`.

---

## **üîπ Example 5: Lexical Scope vs. Dynamic Scope**
Some languages use **dynamic scope**, where a function's scope depends on **where it is called** (not where it is defined). JavaScript **does NOT use dynamic scope**.

### **üîπ Example: Lexical vs. Dynamic Scope**
```javascript
let name = "Global";

function printName() {
    console.log(name);
}

function changeName() {
    let name = "Local";
    printName(); // Prints "Global", NOT "Local"
}

changeName();
```
### **‚úî Why Does It Print `"Global"` Instead of `"Local"`?**
- JavaScript follows **lexical scope**, so `printName()` **looks at where it was defined, NOT where it was called**.
- It was defined in the **global scope**, where `name = "Global"`.

## **üîπ Summary Table**
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lexical Scope** | Inner functions can access variables from outer functions. |
| **Scope Chain** | JavaScript searches for variables in parent functions if not found in the current function. |
| **Parent Cannot Access Child Scope** | Outer functions cannot access variables declared inside inner functions. |
| **Closures Use Lexical Scope** | Functions retain access to their original scope even after execution. |
| **No Dynamic Scope** | JavaScript uses **lexical scoping**, not **dynamic scoping**. |

## **üîπ Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Lexical scope is determined by where functions are written, NOT where they are called.**  
‚úÖ **Inner functions can access parent function variables, but parents cannot access inner variables.**  
‚úÖ **Closures take advantage of lexical scoping to retain access to variables even after execution.**  
‚úÖ **JavaScript uses lexical scoping, NOT dynamic scoping.**
