# What is an anonymous function?

An **anonymous function** is a function **without a name**. These functions are often used when the function is assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or used in an expression.  

---

## **1. Syntax of an Anonymous Function**
```javascript
const greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
};
greet(); // Output: Hello, world!
```
- Here, the function has **no name**, and it is assigned to the variable `greet`.  
- The function can only be accessed using the variable `greet`.

## **2. Characteristics of Anonymous Functions**
✅ **No Name:** They do not have a name after the `function` keyword.  
✅ **Cannot Be Called Before Definition:** Since it's part of an expression, it **isn't hoisted** like function declarations.  
✅ **Used in Callbacks & Higher-Order Functions:** Useful when passing functions as arguments.  
✅ **Assigned to Variables:** Often stored in variables or used in IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

## **3. Examples of Anonymous Functions**
### **A. Function Expression (Assigned to a Variable)**
```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### **B. Callback Function (Passed as an Argument)**
Anonymous functions are often used as **callback functions** in `setTimeout`, `map`, `filter`, and event listeners.

#### **Example: Using `setTimeout`**
```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

#### **Example: Using `map()`**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squared = numbers.map(function(num) {
    return num * num;
});
console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### **C. Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**
Anonymous functions are used in **IIFE**, which executes immediately after being defined.

```javascript
(function() {
    console.log("This function runs immediately!");
})();
```
✔ Useful to **avoid polluting the global scope**.

## **4. Anonymous Function vs Named Function**
| Feature                 | Anonymous Function | Named Function |
|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Has a Name?**        | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Hoisted?**          | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Used in Callbacks?** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Debugging?**        | ❌ Harder (shows as `<anonymous>` in errors) | ✅ Easier |

---

## **5. Arrow Functions as Anonymous Functions**
Arrow functions (`=>`) are another way to write anonymous functions concisely.

```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(4, 2)); // Output: 8
```

---

## **Conclusion**
An **anonymous function** is a function **without a name**, commonly used in **function expressions, callbacks, and IIFE**. While they are useful in many scenarios, **named functions** are preferred when debugging is needed.
