# How do you define a function in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, you can define a function in multiple ways:

### 1. **Function Declaration**  
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }
   ```
   - Can be called before its definition due to **hoisting**.

### 2. **Function Expression**  
   ```javascript
   const greet = function(name) {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   };
   ```
   - Cannot be called before its definition.

### 3. **Arrow Function (ES6)**  
   ```javascript
   const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```
   - Concise syntax, especially useful for short functions.
   - Does **not** have its own `this` context.

### 4. **Anonymous Function (Without a Name, Often Used in Callbacks)**  
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(function() {
       console.log("Hello after 2 seconds!");
   }, 2000);
   ```

### 5. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**  
   ```javascript
   (function() {
       console.log("This runs immediately!");
   })();
   ```

Each method has its own use case, depending on the situation. ðŸš€
